	<h2><center>Reviving the Camera Giant: The Case of Kodak</center></h2>
</div>
<div class="c5">
	<h2 id="Scenario">Scenario</h2>
</div>
<div class="c6">
	<p>Kodak was a well-known multinational company in the 20th century. In 1895, Kodak launched its first pocket camera. In 1970, Kodak acquired 90% of the film industry's market share. During their successful times, Kodak sold film rolls in the market and film rolls were the significant share for their company. During technology development,  Kodak introduced the first digital camera to the market in 1975. Kodak was unable to retain its market position in 2012 due to the emergence of the digital revolution, and its market share was indeed drastically shrinking. As a result, Kodak company seeks the help of a design thinking team to tackle their issue. </p>

</div>
<div class="c6">
	<p>Design thinking is a process for solving design challenges that require first understanding the needs of the user and then creating novel solutions to those needs. As per the Stanford model, empathize, identify, ideate, prototype, and test are the five stages in design thinking.</p>

	<h2 id="Steps in Design Thinking">Steps in Design Thinking</h2>
</div>
<div class="c6">
	<p><b>Empathize:</b> The first phase is to empathize with other people or to imagine yourself in their shoes. This allows the design thinker to analyze the issue from another person's perspective.</p>
</div>
<div class="c6">
    <p><b>Identify:</b> Seeing the situation from the perspective of the other person will surely be eye-opening. It puts light on the problem at hand.</p>
</div>
<div class="c6">
    <p><b>Ideate:</b> To develop new solutions, issues, and new ideas, analyze or test the ideas to identify the best solution applying ideation tools.</p>
</div>
<div class="c6">
    <p><b>Prototype:</b> To create conceptual prototypes of the product in order to further investigate potential solutions and examine various aspects of the situation and how each prototype might solve it.</p>
</div>
<div class="c6">
    <p><b>Test:</b> To test the prototypes through their trials with real humans and internal stakeholders. Let's see how effectively they cope with the challenges that have been highlighted.</p>

<div class="c6">
<div class="c7">
 <ul>
 	<li>What is the cause of the lack of market research? </li>
 	<li>Why did the company not alter its strategy in the face of the digital revolution? </li>
 	<li>Is there a reason why the company concentrated on the product rather than the value it provided?  </li>
 	<li>Did the company invest in research and development in order to gain consumer loyalty?</li>
 	<li>What was the mindset of the employees when the company initially rejected the ideology of digital cameras?</li>
 	<li>What made the consumer shift to digital cameras?</li>
 	<li>Unlike Fujifilm, Kodak's competitor in early times, Why did Kodak not act swiftly and expand its business through innovation and external growth? </li>
 	<li>Did Kodak fail to understand customers' needs and not fit into the trend? </li>
 	<li>Was the upper management and research team cooperative enough with a consistent vision?</li>
 	<li>What is Kodak's strategy for building a presence in digital imaging?</li>

</div>
<div class="c6">
<div class="c7">
 <ul>
 	<li>Kodak fails to do research and development, which would be a vital part of marketing success.</li>
 	<li>One of Kodak's most glaring mistakes would be its promotion of older technologies and refusal to embrace digital photography.</li>
 	<li>Kodak experienced great difficulty in managing the complex and emotionally-charged people issues surrounding a business in decline.</li>
 	<li>Kodak made a purchase, acquiring a photo-sharing site called Ofoto in 2001.</li>
 	<li>Kodak's downfall truly began when Kodak made a late entry to the market with its 1st digital camera in 1991. </li>
 	<li>Kodak was so blinded by its success that it completely missed the rise of digital technologies.</li>
 	<li>Blindness to change and failure to adapt is detrimental to any organization’s long-term survival.</li>
 	<li>The company had the potential and the resources but had no foresight for the transition that the future held for them.</li>
 	<li>As the advantages of film cameras reduced, the consumers became less loyal to the Kodak brand.</li>
 	<li>Kodak was late in the game in their shift to digital and they have been playing catch up.</li>
 	<li>Even when its researchers pushed the technology's boundaries, the Kodak company was unable to envision digital photography as a disruptive technology.</li>

</div>
<div class="c6">
	<p>Even though digital cameras were altering the market, Kodak hesitated to sell the new technology for fear of losing its valuable film industry. Even though digital products were changing the market, the corporation held back on marketing the latest technology for fear of damaging its rich film industry. Kodak has fallen mainly due to factors such as emerging technologies, an inability to anticipate the upcoming digital revolution, and other inadequate management decisions. Moreover, one of the defining factors in its downfall was its inability to compete with its closest rival.</p>

    <h4>Web Application Development:</h4>
    </div>	
   <div class="c6">
  <div class="c7">
	<ul>
	     <li>Kodak was a well-known photography company that has almost vanished from people’s minds.  </li>
	     <li>Kodak’s primary business was film rolls and services.</li>
	     <li>It sold the cameras for cheap to get it into as many hands as possible and planned to make them back in the sales of its consumables such as film rolls and services.</li>
	     <li>It allowed the general public to consider owning a camera and taking photos.</li>
	     <li>This increased the profits and locked the customer into the Kodak ecosystem.</li>
	     <li>Kodak did not halt and rest on their early successes and kept on innovating by inventing Kodachrome, the world’s first color film.</li>
	     <li>Kodak developed the world’s first digital SLR (DSLR) camera.</li>
	     <li>Kodak, over the entirety of its operations, made most of its money from film rolls and felt that it needed to continue and preserve the sales of its film rolls. So even when digital cameras – that Kodak helped invent – gained popularity, Kodak was still focussing on promoting its analogue products such as film rolls.</li>
	     <li>Meanwhile, Kodak’s competitors were starting to catch up to it in terms of price and features. The industry was starting to shift more towards the digital counterparts and less towards film rolls and the analogue cameras.</li>
	     <li>While Kodak had a great run so far, things started going downhill during the 2000s. In 2004, Kodak saw its profits dip even though its sales were at an all-time high. By the time Kodak started focusing on digital products – which it did by releasing a few digital cameras and printers to print the images taken from the digital cameras – it was already too late to capture users who had moved on to other brands.</li>
	     <li>Though Kodak offered digital cameras, people still mostly associated Kodak with film rolls and analogue cameras. </li>
	     <li>After almost operating on a high note for over 130 years, Kodak filed for bankruptcy. It announced that it would be stopping the production of its digital cameras, film rolls (few still remain in production) and digital picture frames.</li>
	     <li>Kodak Gallery, the official photo storage facility of Kodak, stopped functioning due to bankruptcy. Therefore, to avoid customers’ data loss, they ensured to safely and securely transfer the data to Shutterfly, a facility to store and share photos.</li>
	     <li>Based on the study on Kodak’s downfall we find that one of the reasons behind its downfall is not owning a proper user-friendly application to store and share photos.</li>
	</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div class="c6">
	<p><center><b>So our idea is to create an application to store and share photos of kodak cameras in the name of ‘Kodak Gallery Application’.</b></center></p>
</div>
<div class="c6">
	<p style="font-weight: bold;">Features of the Kodak Gallery Application:</p>
	<p>By connecting to a camera with wifi (direct connection or via wireless router), this application provides the following features,</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Transfer and save camera images to a smartphone.</li>
			<li>Remote shooting with live view imaging of the camera from a smartphone.</li>

	<p>This application also provides the following features for compatible cameras,</p>
	<div class="c7">
		<ul>
			<li>Acquire location information from a smartphone and add it to the images on the camera.</li>
			<li>Switch to a wifi connection from pairing status with a Bluetooth enabled camera.</li>

<div class="c6">
	<p><b>User 1:</b> I'm a Photographer and a Studio owner. Whenever I remove the memory card from my camera, it is a hassle to transfer RAW format files to my PC. But the kodak app is very convenient for transferring files from my camera to my account. I also share a few shots to my customers from my mobile using the share option. Thank you, Kodak.</p>
	<p><b>User 2:</b> Connection is seamless and data transfer is fast. The video transfer is good with good compression for casual use. Data transfer is fast and overall a good app and further improvement are appreciated.</p>
	<p><b>User 3:</b> The app allows users to log in using Google accounts, so it’s very easy to sign up or login in to the app with any synced device. The server lags a little at times when opened from multiple devices.</p>
	<p><b>User 4:</b> While saving images  from the app, it saves the image one by one only. Kindly add a download feature for the whole set in a single option. Saving one by one is time-consuming.</p>
	<p><b>User 5:</b> Transferring photos over wifi is as easy as a piece of cake. But transferring video is still a hefty task because you cannot transfer videos over wifi. That is the only drawback here. Other than that, this app is the best. And I hope future updates support video transfer over camera wifi on this app. </p>
	<p><b>User 6:</b> It's good to have a dedicated app from the Camera maker. The app is good enough to transfer files (both images and clips) from the Cameras. It creates a private folder to store pictures from the camera separately in the mobile Gallery. </p>
	<p><b>User 7:</b> It allows primary Remote Camera Operation, through which it's possible to click images from a distance using a WIFI-enabled mobile device. However, the feature can not be used for recording videos, which, I feel, should have been there. </p>
	<p><b>User 8:</b> This app is so user-friendly. It allows us to share high-resolution pictures on
Whatsapp, Instagram, Snapchat, and Facebook without downloading, which I liked. 
The functions are pretty good-Overall a good app with minimal flaws. 
</p>
	<p><b>User 9:</b> I don't have any issues connecting to my camera. I'm not allowed to download RAW files on my iPhone.But the feature is working fine on my Android Phone. Please look into this issue and rectify it as soon as possible. </p>
